## ALFT: M5L2 - Conditional Statements Demo

Let’s write a program that suggests what to wear based on the temperature.

Example:

If the weather is 50° or below, wear winter jacket

If the weather is 70° or below, wear a light jacket

If the weather is 80° or below, wear a t-shirt

If the weather is 90° or below, wear shorts

etc.
